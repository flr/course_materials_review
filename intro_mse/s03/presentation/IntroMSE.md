# Fisheries management

# Goals of fisheries management

## Goals

- Sustainable benefits from harvesting
- Conserve stock(s) productivity
- Minimise impacts on ecosystem

## Requirements

- Set of clear management objectives
- Indication of proper harvest and/or stock level
- Means to monitor status
- Measures to control fishing on advice

# Challenges of fisheries management

- Objectives set to be operational
- Trade-offs between short and long term
- Monitoring impact to ecosystem
- Quantifiying uncertainty in status andn dynamics
- Making decisions acknowledging risks

# How to deal with all this? MSE

> Assessing the consequences of a range of different management strategies to determine which one will be the most appropriate to meet the operational objectives of the fishery.

## Goals

1. Robustness against uncertainty.
2. Compare relative performance of alternative MPs.
3. Simulation-test MPs under a wide(r) range of realities.

# Where does this come from?

- IWC ![iwc](figs/iwc.png){width=15%}\
- New Management Procedure

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{figs/nmp}

- Revised Management Procedure
- Catch Limit Algorithm (CLA)

# IWC: Uncertainties in RMP[ยน]

- Alternative population models.
- Initial population size from 5-99% of unexploited (initial, pre-whaling).
- Rates of productivity and chnages over time.
- Uncertainty and bias in the estimated population size.
- Frequencies of abundance surveys (every 1, 5 or 10 years).
- Changes in carrying capacity (climate change, habitat degragation).
- Errors in historic records of catches.
- Occurrence of catastrophes simulating unpredictable (major disease).
- Uncertainty about stock structure.

# A model of the fishery system

# Six steps to MSE [^1]

- Define and agree on **objectives** & **limits**
- Identify appropriate **Management Procedures**
- Define a set of **Operating Models**
- Conduct **simulations**
- Summarize **performance**
- Select best **MP**

# Define **objectives** & **limits**

- IOTC: target=$B_{MSY}$, limit=$0.40\cdot B_{MSY}$, also $P(Green) > 60\%$, over next 20 
years.

# What are the advantages?

- Avoid being driven by yearly variability in SA
- Long-term trade-offs made clear
- Less haggling
- No *wrong* best assessment
- Default decision
- Risk on board
- Consistent with PA
- Interaction across the table

# And disadvantages?

- Results dependent on model (as usual)
- Lengthy development (less and less so)
- Data still essential (indeed)
- Overly rigid (up to you)
- Autopilot (exceptional circumstances)
