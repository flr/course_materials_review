- package captioner for tutorial not mantained anymore
- tutorial "An overview of the FLCore classes" is incomplete, describes only the FLQuant, for which there is a specific tutorial. In general the tutorials and help pages linked here need to be finalized or updated 
- as.data.frame qname column changed to slot?
- metrics(nple4, Catch=catch, Landings=landings) gives an error. The metrics method always returns Rec, SSB, Catch and F; and adds others on the same list, which in this case gives an error since there's 2 "Catch" elements in the metrics list

function (object, metrics, ...) 
{
    foo <- selectMethod("metrics", c(object = "FLS", metrics = "list"))
    res <- foo(object = object, metrics = c(list(Rec = rec, SSB = ssb, 
        Catch = catch, F = fbar), list(...)))
    if (units(harvest(object)) == "HR") 
        names(res)[[4]] <- "HR"
    return(res)
}
